# Github Language Stats

Using this NodeJS project you can analyse your Github repositories regarding the used programming languages.

## How to use this (will be extended in the future)

1. Be aware of the [limitations](#limitations)
2. Fork this repository and edit the config

## Limitations

-   currently private repos are not supported
-   may not work with large repositories
-   not every language (but every language can be added)

## Possible Improvements

-   add more languages
-   make colors for languages better
-   add support for private repos
-   more in-depth code analysis (therefore more stats)
-   more config options (e.g. add languages in config)

## Contributing

-   Issues can be used for bugs and for feature requests (although these might take some time).
-   You can contribute with a PR.
-   If there is anything else, open an issue
